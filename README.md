# History 
- Model was downloaded on 07/13/2022 from the [pkasolver GitHub repository](https://github.com/mayrf/pkasolver). 
- Use case was inspired by the provided [query notebook](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos2b6f/blob/main/model/framework/pkasolver/notebooks/query_example.ipynb).
- Edited the imports of the following scripts to ensure compatibility and eliminate setup.py install command: (call_dimorphite_dl.py, dimorphite_dl.py, query.py, constants.py, data.py, ml.py, ml_architecture.py)
- Commented unnecessary visualization code in query.py
- Model was incorporated into Ersilia on 07/13/2022.
